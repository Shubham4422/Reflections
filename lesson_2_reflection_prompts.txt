What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	With this we can track the changes which may occur from there onwards though Git bash. We need it to simply the maintenance
	of our project.
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
	Staging area gives us the indication that the following file is under the consideration of git and any changes to it will 
	be traced. However working directory is the one where all of our git commands will executed.
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
	We can add al the files which ned=ed to be modified and can create a single commit for them altogether by keeping them in 
	the staging area before Repository.
What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?
	When we are not sure that the changes we are about to make worth, branches can be made to the main file so that if we need
	to update the main version we might not need to worry about the changes we made for the branched version.
How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?
